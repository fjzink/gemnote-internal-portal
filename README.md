# Gemnote Internal Portal
[Deployed App](https://gemnote-portal.herokuapp.com/)

This is my internal portal for product management. You can select a customer from the dropdown menu, add products to the order, and submit the order to an outside invoicing system (mocked using beeceptor).

The front end was built with React and the backend was build with Rails. For the front end I used my own [Webpack configuration](https://github.com/fjzink/react-boilerplate). The back end was built as a JSON API to serve data to the front end.

Example ```POST``` request to beeceptor:
